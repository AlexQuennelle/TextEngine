  - text: |
      This is the first scene.
      A scene consists of text with a set of dialogue options to choose from.

      The text can contain newlines and whitespace as long as a vertical bar is placed before the text starts and the text itself is indented by 2 spaces.
      "what about quotation marks" you ask?
      Not a problem!
    options:
      # dialogue options consist of text and the ID of the scene it takes you to
      # the text follows all the same rules as the scene text
      # both of these follow general YAML rules
      # yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/ has more detailed info
      # the scene ID specifies the scene an option takes you to
      # the first scene in this file is scene 0
      # all subsequent scenes count up from there
      # a scene ID of -1 ends the game and takes you back to the start menu
